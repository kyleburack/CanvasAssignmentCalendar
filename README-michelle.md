Mainly I researched and worked on how to create and understand the actual extension in Chrome via html since 
I wasn't super familiar with it outside of what we had done in class. We also met on a Zoom call to collectively
work on how to convert our Python code to Javascript to be able to use the Canvas API with the extension.
